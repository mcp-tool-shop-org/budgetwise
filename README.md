- **Envelope Budgeting**: Allocate every dollar to a purpose
- **Multiple Accounts**: Track checking, savings, credit cards, cash
- **Transaction Tracking**: Categorize and search your spending

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 (1809+) or Windows 11
- Visual Studio (2022 17.8+ or newer) with:
  - .NET Desktop Development workload
  - Windows App SDK C# Templates
  - Windows SDK / MSIX (Appx/PRI build tools)
- .NET 9 SDK

**Note on CLI builds (WinUI):** The WinUI project (`BudgetWise.App`) runs Windows App SDK build steps that require the Appx/MSIX + PRI MSBuild task assemblies. If you see an error like `MSB4062` referencing missing `Microsoft.Build.AppxPackage.dll` or `Microsoft.Build.Packaging.Pri.Tasks.dll`, install the Windows SDK / MSIX components via the Visual Studio Installer (or build the app from within Visual Studio).

### Building

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### How to Run the App

**Visual Studio (recommended)**

1. Open `BudgetWise.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Set `BudgetWise.App` as the startup project.
3. Run with **F5**.

**CLI (build + launch)**

```bash
dotnet build .\src\BudgetWise.App\BudgetWise.App.csproj -c Debug
```

If this fails with `MSB4062`, see the note in **Prerequisites**.

Then run the generated exe from the build output folder under:

- `.\src\BudgetWise.App\bin\Debug\net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0\`

**Local data location**

The app creates a local SQLite database at:

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BudgetWise\budgetwise.db`

### Running Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```
